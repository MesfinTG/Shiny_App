## What is this app for?
- This app organizes and presents data in a visual way that is easy to read.  
- It enables the user to spot the information provided at a glance. 
- In essence, it's a dashboard and reporting tool.

- The app uses the USPersonalExpenditures data by expense category in billions of dollars during the 1940 to 1960 (Tukey, 1977). 
**** Data from Tukey (1977), Exploratory Data Analysis, Addison-Wesley.

## What to do?
- The default barchart displays data for the food and tobacco category.

- There are five different expenditure categories to choose from:

1. Food and Tobacco
2. Household Operation
3. Medical and Health

## What to expect?
- Once a user makes a selection in the side panel, the barchart in the main panel instantly refershes with data for the selected expenditure category.
